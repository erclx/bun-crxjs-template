# CHANGELOG REFERENCE

## RULES

- Standard: Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
- Hierarchy: H1 title, H2 version+date or `[Unreleased]`, H3 category.
- Categories: Use `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Deprecated`, `Security` as H3 headers.
- Entry Format: `- component: description from user perspective` (no bold markers or special formatting).
- Spacing: Include one blank line between H3 category headers and bullet lists.
- Version Links: Place at bottom in reverse chronological order; `[Unreleased]` compares latest release to HEAD.
- Content: Include only user-facing changes; exclude internal refactors, typos, CI/CD updates, and dependency bumps unless they affect functionality.

## CONSTRAINTS

- Do not include commits that do not affect end users (formatting changes, internal refactors, test updates).
- Do not use bold formatting for component names in entries.
- Do not write in prose; use concise bullet points.
- Do not include version sections with no meaningful changes.
- Do not mix developer-focused and user-focused changes in the same entry.
